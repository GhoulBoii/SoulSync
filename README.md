# üéµ SoulSync - Automated Music Discovery and Collection Manager

SoulSync is a powerful desktop application designed to bridge the gap between your music streaming habits on Spotify and your personal, high-quality music library in Plex. It automates the process of discovering new music, finding missing tracks from your favorite playlists, and sourcing them from the Soulseek network via slskd.

The core philosophy of SoulSync is to let you enjoy music discovery on Spotify while it handles the tedious work of building and maintaining a pristine, locally-hosted music collection for you in Plex. Plex is not required for the app to function but slskd and Spotify API are required.

The entire system is designed to feel fast and fluid even during heavy operations, with **professional-grade error handling** and **automatic service recovery** ensuring uninterrupted operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a clear, automated workflow to enhance and expand your music library:

1. **Connect Services**: First, you authenticate with your Spotify and Plex accounts and connect to your running slskd instance through the settings panel. This gives SoulSync the access it needs to work its magic.

2. **Analyze**: Navigate to the Sync page and select a Spotify playlist. SoulSync fetches all tracks and compares them against your Plex library. This comparison uses a sophisticated matching engine that looks at track title, artist, album, and duration to make an accurate assessment.

3. **Identify Missing**: After the analysis, the application generates a clear, actionable list of tracks that are present in the Spotify playlist but are not found in your Plex library.

4. **Search & Download**: For each missing track, SoulSync generates multiple optimized search queries to increase the likelihood of finding a high-quality match. It then uses the slskd API to search the Soulseek network, prioritizing FLAC files and reliable users, and automatically queues them for download.

5. **Organize & Enhance**: Once a download is complete, SoulSync automatically organizes the file from the download directory into the transfer directory, creating a clean folder structure based on the artist and album (`/Transfer/Artist Name/Artist Name - Album Name/Track.flac`). Immediately after organization, the metadata enhancement system enriches the file with accurate Spotify data including proper artist/album names, track numbers, release dates, genres, and high-quality embedded album art. This ensures every file emerges perfectly tagged and ready for Plex, requiring no manual metadata editing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get SoulSync up and running on your system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Python 3.8+**: The core runtime for the application.
- **Plex Media Server(NOT REQUIRED)**: You need a running Plex server with an existing music library that SoulSync can scan.
- **slskd**: A headless Soulseek client. This is the engine that powers the downloading feature. See detailed setup instructions below.
- **Spotify Account**: A regular or premium Spotify account is required to access your playlists and artist data.

### Setting Up slskd

This application requires **slskd**, a web-based Soulseek client, to handle music downloads. Here's how to set it up:

#### Installing slskd

**Option 1: Manual Installation (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Download the latest release from [slskd GitHub releases](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/releases)
2. Extract and run the executable
3. Default web interface will be available at `http://localhost:5030`

**Option 2: Docker (MAYBE? UNTESTED)**
```bash
# Create directories for slskd
mkdir -p ~/slskd/{config,downloads,incomplete}

# Run slskd container
docker run -d \
  --name slskd \
  -p 5030:5030 \
  -p 50300:50300 \
  -v ~/slskd/config:/app/config \
  -v ~/slskd/downloads:/app/downloads \
  -v ~/slskd/incomplete:/app/incomplete \
  slskd/slskd:latest
```

#### Configuring slskd

1. **Initial Setup**: Open `http://localhost:5030` in your browser
2. **Create Account**: Set up your admin username and password  
3. **Soulseek Credentials**: Enter your Soulseek username and password
4. **API Key**: Create a random 16-character API key:
   - Generate a random string (letters and numbers) like `abc123def456ghi7`
   - Add this to your slskd configuration file as the API key
   - Use the same key in SoulSync configuration
5. **CONFIG SETUP**: An application directory will be created in either ~/.local/share/slskd (on Linux and macOS) or %localappdata%/slskd (on Windows). In the root of this directory the file slskd.yml will be created the first time the application runs. Edit this file to enter your credentials for the Soulseek network, and tweak any additional settings using the

**Important Notes:**
- slskd must be running before starting SoulSync
- Make sure your Soulseek account has sharing enabled to avoid connection issues
- The default port 5030 can be changed in slskd settings if needed

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nezreka/SoulSync
   cd soulsync-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è First-Time Setup: A Critical Step

**IMPORTANT**: SoulSync will not function until you provide your API keys and service details. You must do this before you start using the app's features. You have two options for this initial setup:

#### Option 1 (Recommended): Use the In-App Settings Page

1. Launch the application (`python main.py`).
2. The very first thing you should do is navigate to the **Settings** page using the sidebar.
3. Fill in all the required fields for Spotify, Plex, and Soulseek.
4. Click "Save Settings". The app is now ready to use.
5. Restart the app for good luck.

#### Option 2: Edit the config.json File Manually

1. **Locate the Configuration File**: Before launching the app, find the `config.json` file in the `config/` directory of the project.
2. **Configure API Keys and URLs**: Open the file and fill in the details as described below.

### Configuration Details

Open the `config.json` file and fill in the details for Spotify, Plex, and Soulseek.

#### üìÅ Important: Understanding Download vs Transfer Folders

- **download_path**: This should be the exact same folder where slskd saves its downloads (e.g., the downloads folder you configured in slskd). SoulSync monitors this folder for completed downloads.
- **transfer_path**: This is where SoulSync moves and organizes the processed files. Typically, this should be your main Plex music library folder, so the files are immediately available to Plex after processing.

#### ‚ùó Important: slskd API Key Setup

The slskd API key is crucial for the application to communicate with your Soulseek client.

1. **Find your slskd config file**: This is typically a `slskd.yml` or `slskd.json` file located where you installed slskd.
2. **Locate the API key**: Inside the slskd configuration, find the `api_key` value you have set. It will look something like this:
   ```yaml
   # slskd.yml example
   api:
     key: "your-secret-api-key-goes-here"
   ```
3. **Copy and Paste**: Copy the exact API key from your slskd configuration.
4. **Update config.json**: Paste the key into the `api_key` field under the `soulseek` section in the SoulSync app's `config.json` file.

Alternatively, you can paste this key directly into the API Key field in the Settings menu within the application after launching it.

```json
{
  "spotify": {
    "client_id": "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret": "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
  },
  "plex": {
    "base_url": "<YOUR_PLEX_SERVER_URL>",
    "token": "<YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN>"
  },
  "soulseek": {
    "slskd_url": "<YOUR_SLSKD_URL>",
    "api_key": "<YOUR_SLSKD_API_KEY>",
    "download_path": "./path/to/slskd/download/folder",
    "transfer_path": "./path/to/music/folder"
  },
  "logging": {
    "path": "logs/app.log",
    "level": "INFO"
