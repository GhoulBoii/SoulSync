# Spotify Matched Download System - Technical Specification

## Expected Use Case for a single(mostly the same for album?)
User clicks 'matched download' button on a 'single'  and an elegant modal expands into view that offers two options: the top half (spotify auto matching with a list or slideshow or top 5 likely artists), the bottom half(manual use search on spotify to match the track to an artist). the app will use spotify metadata to update the track name and create the folder structure I detailed. so lets talk about the top half of the modal first. It will automatically populate the top 5 most likely artists to match the track with. each likely artist will display, if possible, the artist image, artist name, and percentage likelihood of match. clicking the artist will select that artist as the matched artist and the download will begin. now the bottom half:  it will be a simple but elegant search bar for the user to search for an artist and it will display a list of 5 results similar to the top half but these results are user searched. it will display the same content, artist picture, artist name, percentage liklihood of match. clicking the artist will select that artist as the matched artist and the download will begin. So now that the user has decided which artist the track belongs to the track has begun downloading as normal to the download folder. the track and its parent folder will then appear in the downloads folder once complete. but while the track is downloading the app should attempt to gather additional information about the artist / album / track. specifically we will need to see if the track we downloaded was part of an album and if it is, make sure we create the correct folder structure. if a track is a single. it is layed out like this:
```
Transfer/
â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE ARTIST/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE ARTIST - EXAMPLE SINGLE/
    â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
    â”œâ”€â”€ cover.png/jpg
```
if we determine a track we downloaded is part of an album by the matched artist it would be setup like this:

```
Transfer/
â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE ARTIST/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE ARTIST - EXAMPLE ALBUM/
        â”œâ”€â”€ TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        â”œâ”€â”€ cover.png/jpg
```

If we happen to download multiple tracks from the same album they should all end up with the same folder structure and in the same location.

```
Transfer/
â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE ARTIST/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EXAMPLE ARTIST - EXAMPLE ALBUM/
        â”œâ”€â”€ TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        â”œâ”€â”€ TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        â”œâ”€â”€ TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        â”œâ”€â”€ cover.png/jpg
        â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    
```

All accurate title information and cover art for albums, tracks, artists can be found with the matched artist via spotify api. this information is used to for renaming tracks and folders. That way we know tracks and albums will end up together with albums and artists having the exact same name. After we determine if the track is part of an album or not we can begin copying the download to the 'transfer' folder and creating the appropriate folder structure from above and rename the track as needed. After the folder structure is setup correctly we will begin updating the metadata within the actual track file based on the data pulled from spotify. Things like title, track number, genres, album, contributing artists and anything else spotify api provides. once folder structure is done and metadata data for all tracks is done, then delete the original download in the downloads folder and run 'clear completed' buttons function. now with everything cleaned up we can move on to the next matched download.

Now we need to incorporate this functionality into full album downloads by adding a 'matched album download' button beside the 'download album' button. this will essentially do the exact same process as singles but its a big batch added to the queue. we can't assume what we are downloading is an actual 'album' by an artist but could instead be a folder of a users favorite songs. but our app would download those songs and put them in the correct artist folder with correct metadata. if you think im missing intuitive or critical please add it in.

If we fail to match an artist in the modal, treat the download as a normal downoad without any matching and keep it in the downloads folder. Also any matched downloads need to update the 'download queue' the same way a normal download would. The cancel button should remain functional on a matched download in the queue and clicking it should behave exaclty the same. a finished matched download should transfer to finished downloads as expected.

Remix should be handled elegantly. If artist A does a remix of Artist B song. The song artist will be Artist A with a contributting artist of Artist B.
the matching system should be super extensive and robust and professional. at the level of Spotify, Google, Facebook and Apple. So logical, practical and sophisticated it would make them proud. I provided how i want this to play out. I expect a 'Matched Download' button do appear on all singles and all tracks inside albums beside the 'download' button. and albums should  have a matched download button as well that match downloads all tracks in the album. The modal should be beautiful, elegant, and provide space for content to fit. We should be very smart with our api calls to spotify so we don't reach limits. If it doesn't need to be in another file, then don't put it in one. you can do this. Give your best work. I'ts also very important that you come to this document and update the TODO list with what you are doing, what you are going to do next. And udpating the TODO list at each step.
