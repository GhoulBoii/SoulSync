create me an app with python. it will have an elegant and animated and virant theme and layout similar to the Spotify desktop app or web app. 
The app will connect to both spotify and my plex media server so i want a central file called config.json that stores all of the api and login information for connected services.
The app will have multiple functionalities.
the app will pull the data for all spotify user playlists. it will sync the playlists to plex mediaserver using an extensive, robust matching system, multiple methods.
The app will connect to soulseek and search for flac or user selected quality to download albums and singles by an artist with an extensive matching system.
the app will update the music metadata on plex based off the spotify metadata that is provided. including album art.

the core functionality should feel and look like spotify.
