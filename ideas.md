## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- **Scheduling**: Use system cron/task scheduler or internal timer-based system
- **Background Processing**: Implement as low-priority background threads to not interfere with user operations
- **Duplicate Detection**: Consider using audio fingerprinting libraries (like chromaprint) for accurate detection
- **Quality Comparison**: Implement bitrate/format ranking system (FLAC > 320 MP3 > lower quality)

### User Interface Requirements
- **Settings**: Add scheduling options to settings page
- **Progress Monitoring**: Dashboard widgets to show background operation status
- **User Control**: Ability to pause/resume background operations
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for completed background operations

## Future Considerations
- **Storage Management**: Warning system when disk space gets low
- **Bandwidth Control**: Throttling options for background downloads
- **Conflict Resolution**: User preference settings for handling duplicates and quality upgrades
